function [p, h, stats] = mysignrank(x,y,alpha)
%SIGNRANK Wilcoxon signed rank test for zero median.
%   P = SIGNRANK(X) performs a two-sided signed rank test of the hypothesis
%   that the data in the vector X come from a distribution whose median
%   (and mean, if it exists) is zero, and returns the p-value from the
%   test.  P is the probability of observing the given result, or one more
%   extreme, by chance if the null hypothesis ("median is zero") is true.
%   Small values of P cast doubt on the validity of the null hypothesis.
%   The data are assumed to come from a continuous distribution, symmetric
%   about its median.
%
%   P = SIGNRANK(X,M) performs a two-sided test of the hypothesis that the
%   data in the vector X come from a distribution whose median is M.  M
%   must be a scalar.
%
%   P = SIGNRANK(X,Y) performs a paired, two-sided test of the hypothesis
%   that the difference between the matched samples in the vectors X and Y
%   comes from a distribution whose median is zero.  The differences X-Y
%   are assumed to come from a continuous distribution, symmetric about its
%   median.  X and Y must be the same length.
%
%   [P,H] = SIGNRANK(...) returns the result of the hypothesis test,
%   performed at the 0.05 significance level, in H.  H==0 indicates that
%   the null hypothesis ("median is zero") cannot be rejected at the 5%
%   level. H==1 indicates that the null hypothesis can be rejected at the
%   5% level.
%
%   [P,H] = SIGNRANK(...,ALPHA) returns the result of the hypothesis test
%   performed at the significance level ALPHA.
%
%   [P,H,STATS] = SIGNRANK(...) returns STATS, a structure with one or two
%   fields.  The field 'signedrank' contains the value of the signed rank
%   statistic.  If the sample size is large, then P is calculated using a
%   normal approximation and the field 'zval' contains the value of the
%   normal (Z) statistic.
